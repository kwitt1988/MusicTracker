# MusicTracker
An application which aims at creating curated content for the user.

Right now the user is able to log-in through Spotify and get ones API-tokens. 

With these tokens one can make API-request for example with the help of Postman.

Next step would be either to start writing functions to store different data to a database, or feed it into some form of real-time analysis.

Currently V0.1 live at http://164.90.182.47:3000/

Feel free to unlink app from Spotify at https://www.spotify.com/us/account/apps/
